# Why blog?

_May 2nd, 2019 · 2 minute read · #blogging_

While learning Rust I was struggling with certain concepts so I tried to organize my thoughts by writing them down in markdown files and I soon had several markdown files. I thought _"Maybe I should start a blog?"_ but then I realized _"I probably shouldn't, my posts will never be as good as anything written on Rust by Niko Matsakis, Saoirse Shipwreckt, Huon Wilson, David Tolnay, Alexis Beingessner, Daniel Keep, Carl Fredrik Samson, Aleksey Kladov, Amos Wegner, Pascal Hertleif, Dimitri Sabadie, Daniel Henry-Mantilla, Steve Klabnik, Jake Goulding, or Carol Nichols"_. That list isn't even exhaustive, there's easily dozens of people I left out! There's lots of super smart people who are already writing about Rust. However, I have one unique advantage that none of those people have: I'm average Joe. Super smart people tend to write super smart articles that only other super smart people understand. There's a gap in the market for us dummies, and it's that gap I intend to fill with my writing.
